- Figure out algorithm to find shortest distance between two airports(must have 1 transition airport in between) - use any shortest path algorithm
- User input: Initial_country, Destination_country
- Function output: Best airport transition

Newspaper
(up to you to use whatever python library you want)
- List out newspaper of chosen airports' country (must be english)
- Extract political part of the newspaper(see example for more info)
- Figure out algorithm to find which of the countries has a more positive political status
- Save positive/negative words in a json/txt file so it can be read by the function to search for positive/negative words (can find words from website given in the assignment example)
- User input: array of country airport
- Function output: ditionary of airports in order of most positive airport
- E.g output:
- {"Changi Airport": {"Positive": "70", "Negative": "10"},
"SomeOtherAirport": {"Positive": "58", "Negative": "32"}}
- Positive can be calculated where (positive_words/total_words)*100percent
- Negative does not have to be (100 - positive) since there are neutral words too
- Plot histogram graph of postive words n negative words
